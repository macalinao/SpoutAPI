/**
 * This class implements a Cuboid common methods for a one dimensional array
 * Cuboid Buffer
 *
 * Elements are stored in column order and each column is +1 on the Z dimension
 * relative to the previous one.
 *
 * Each YZ plane is followed by the plane corresponding to +1 on the X
 * dimension.
 *
 * It is assumed that the Cuboid has dimensions (SX, SY, SZ) and the base is set
 * at the origin.
 *
 * buffer[0] = data(0, 0, 0 ) buffer[1] = data(0, 1, 0 ) ..... buffer[SY-1] =
 * data(0, SY-1, 0 ) buffer[SY] = data(0, 0 1 ) .... buffer[SZ*SY - 1] = data(0,
 * SY-1, SZ-1) buffer[SZ*SY] = data(1, 0, 0 ) .... buffer[SZ*SY*SX -1] =
 * data(SX-1, SY-1, SZ-1)
 *
 * TODO is this the best package to put this?
